The project i created was a virtual clock in which the user could determine the time, add a second, minute, or even hour. 

What i was able to paticularly well was get the clock to function correctly at each of the users inputs according to the examples which we were provided. Each of the users inputs led to a correct analysis by the code and sucsessfully correct output. 

An area in which i could enhance my code would be to display the current Real Life time and then allow the user to do as they please with the built in functions. As for effecientcy and security, i belive the code is already as secure and efficient as possible.

The portion of my code which i found to be the most challenging would definatly be the functions allowing the user to add a second/minute/hour as this portion required many differnt implementations of what we had previously learned in zybooks. In order to overcome these obsticles, i reviewed the zybooks virtual textbook almost religiously. I also did some general web browsing for any errors that occured in order to properly address them and solve them. 

The skills i gained from this project that transferred to future work includes my problem solving capabilities and drive for success. 

I was able to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving enough room for additional code which could improve the project in the future but not enough to make it look incomplete.
