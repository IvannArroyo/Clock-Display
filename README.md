The project i created was a virtual clock in which the user could determine the time, add a second, minute, or even hour.

What I was able to do particularly well was get the clock to function correctly at each of the user's inputs according to the examples that we were provided. Each of the users inputs led to a correct analysis by the code and successfully correct output.

An area in which I could enhance my code would be to display the current Real Life time and then allow the user to do as they please with the built-in functions. As for efficiency and security, I believe the code is already as secure and efficient as possible.

The portion of my code that I found to be the most challenging would definitely be the functions allowing the user to add a second/minute/hour as this portion required many different implementations of what we had previously learned in Zybooks. In order to overcome these obstacles, I reviewed the Zybooks virtual textbook almost religiously. I also did some general web browsing for any errors that occurred in order to properly address them and solve them.

The skills I gained from this project that transferred to future work includes my problem-solving capabilities and drive for success.

I was able to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by leaving enough room for additional code which could improve the project in the future but not enough to make it look incomplete.
